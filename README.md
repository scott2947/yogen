## Versions
### 0.1.0
Aim: Prototype the machine learning lifecycle (with the exception of model monitoring and maintenance).<br>
Notes: This means the model is unrefined (so should not be used).
### 0.2.0
Aim: Implement an LSTM for improved time series prediction.<br>
Notes: Anticipated issues with the small amount of training examples have manifested.
## Future possibilities
- Different approaches to training (e.g. cross-validation for time series data)
- Different approaches to tuning (e.g. using KerasTuner)
- Obtain more data, including for other stocks
